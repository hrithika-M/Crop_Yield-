# Crop_Yield-
This project focuses on performing statistical hypothesis testing using independent two-sample t-tests to evaluate the effect of water levels on crop yield under different fertilizer conditions. The goal is to determine whether the variation in crop yield is statistically significant between high and low water usage within each fertilizer type.
